My relevenat experience over the years is no doubt much needed in the Corporate Communications and Media world, but more importantly is an expertise in technology and the digital field, so i could render acquired skills and experiences effectively, in line with changing global digitalisation , as well as explore inherent talents and creativity;hence the need to be a part of the Tech Expert Academy.
