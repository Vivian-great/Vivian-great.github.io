## About

Hi, you are welcome to my world.

As you may already figure, my name is Vivian Uwandu.

I hail from the eastern part of the country Nigeria where the culture is predominantly 'Igbo'.

Like any other child raised in a city, i had my primary, secondary and tetiary school education in the city of Port-Harcourt, Rivers State - Nigeria. I went on to serve numerous organisations at different capacities, most importantly Lafarge Africa Plc , where I have over 8years working experience in Sales and marketing, Customer service and relations.
 
Currently, i function in the capacity of a Sales Admin Manager in the Sales and Marketing Department of Lafarge Readymix BU, Lafarge Africa Plc - A member of Lafargeholcim, where i have proven my strong moral and ethical principles, distinct interpersonal relationship skills, sound communication skills, self-motivating and promptness in meeting customer needs. I possess organizational and innovative skills, work excellence, capacity to function without close supervision, persuasive with an insatiable thirst for learning, all of which are key to fostering a long term, defined and structured career progression, as well as adding optimum value to my employer. It is worthy to note that i am a dynamic high achiever, flexible and adaptive to progressive change.

My relevant experience over the years is no doubt much needed in the Corporate Communications and Media space, but more importantly is a skilled expertise in technology and the digital field, which is key in today's corporate functionality and relevance, as a part of an ever changing/evolving global village. An acquired tech skill will also allow for me to explore inherent talents and creativity, hence the need to be a part of the Tech Expert Academy. 

i shall be documenting my experiences on the journery at the Tech Expert Academy, hence you will need to explore my website to see.

Let me also mention that I have authored two books: ‘My Life in High Heels’ and ‘How to Enjoy Your Job Again’- Year 2020, and I was a critical part of a Key-User group that effectively migrated/transmitted to a new Business Enterprise Software Application – SAP, at Lafarge Africa Plc. - Year 2018. So you see, technology is not new to me. The social media space is not alien to me as well, for there i create and share interesting content arround Lifestyle and relationships.

I am an ardent lover of tasty artistic food, a skilled music and movie critic who loves to travel and explore other cultures. 

More importantly, I am a proud mother of two active boys, and we currently reside in Lagos-Nigeria.

See you arround!
